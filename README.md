# MLIP-GrPt_CrystGrow-H2React

## Overview
This repository provides resources and workflows for modeling Pt-functionalized graphene using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), focusing on the nucleation and growth of Pt on graphene and its hydrogen reactivity for applications in sensing and storage.

### Key Highlights:
1. **Equivariant Neural Network Potential (NNP):**  
   - Trained and deployed for molecular dynamics (MD) annealing and minima hopping simulations.  
   - Enables the prediction of Pt/graphene crystal structures at tens of nanometer scales under varying Pt loadings.

2. **Nucleation and Growth Dynamics:**  
   - Analyzed the behavior of Pt atoms on graphene, including their nucleation and growth patterns.

3. **Hydrogen Reactivity Modeling:**  
   - Assessed hydrogen capture efficiency, dissociation, and recombination rates on optimized Pt/graphene structures.  
   - Identified optimal Pt loadings for hydrogen sensing and storage.
